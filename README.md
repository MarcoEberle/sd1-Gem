# Gem

This is my solution to the assignment **Gem** of class **software developement 1**, written in Java. 

More information can be seen in the comments of the source code. 

### Requirements:
This program consists of two classes: **GemBox** to collect the Gems and **Gem** as enum class which represents a speficic Gem.

#### Class GemBox

This class represents a gem box. It is possible to fill it up with three types of gems. Also it's possible to fill it up, remove some and use the magic alchemy to change every gem of one kind to another.

#### Enum Gem

This enum class represents the gems.
